[New Dawn]{.c11}

[Basically a drone control ship.]{.c5}

[Physical Design]{.c8} {#h.bjcucrivv2c4 .c7}
======================

[Based off of the Shadow Broker\'s base.]{.c5 .c10}

[Drones]{.c8} {#h.pip52jxso1zl .c7}
=============

[The drones are called Starlets/Starlet drones.]{.c5}

[Milestones]{.c8} {#h.p7rim0rospys .c7}
=================

-   [Dr]{.c10}[ones that can undock, navigate to any arbitrary point,
    and redock to the New Dawn, all while avoiding colliding with the
    New Dawn, asteroids, and each other, if possible.]{.c5 .c10}

[Long-term Goals]{.c8} {#h.fgarv2ve41ag .c7}
======================

-   [Drones and ship working both in space, and in gravity well and
    atmosphere.]{.c5 .c10}

[Ideas]{.c8} {#h.id0nzujlhole .c7}
============

[]{.c5}

-   [The drones should eventually have interchangeable tool heads that
    they can coordinate with the ship facilities to exchange
    automatically.]{.c5}
-   [The drones\' software can\'t be easily broadcast and updated? So
    need a version field in communications, or capability reporting?
    Overkill.]{.c5}
-   [How to update all required computers? Just not have many on the New
    Dawn? Drone control should probably be separate from other ship
    functions.]{.c5}
-   [Laser antennas vs. antennas, do we want the New Dawn to be able to
    be stealthy (both in view and friendlies picking up
    broadcasts)?]{.c5}
-   [Drone collision detection using camera raycast or sensors or
    both?]{.c5}
-   [When drones are taken control of manually, eg. through remote
    control, they should report this to the mothership which can display
    that and who is controlling it.]{.c5}
-   [Drone program to latch onto other ships and push them into crashing
    on a planet.]{.c5}
-   Drones should be able to be highly independent, eg. sent to mine
    somewhere far away like suggested in

-   [Drone's keep track of where the mothership's last reported position
    is so they can go back to it.]{.c5}
-   Flight control: getting up to speed and cruising, eg.

-   [Docking: move to point a little bit away from connector, re-orient,
    go back until hit connector, lock.]{.c5}
-   [The New Dawn can on startup check for Starlets, and offer to build
    more if slots aren\'t filled. It can also reinitialize their names
    based on the slot they\'re in.]{.c5}
-   [Specialized large ship antenna-boost drones? Laser antennas?
    Handoff depending on situation?]{.c5}
-   [Building more drones from merge blocks, connect to connector, then
    delink merge block?]{.c5}
-   New Dawn asteroid database - the mothership keeps track of asteroids
    drones (and the ship itself) encounter so future drones can plot a
